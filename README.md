# plumber

This is a python toolkit to read and analyze results from the *PLUMBER* experiment ([Best et al. 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/jhm-d-14-0158.1)), which consists of output from land surface models, statistical benchmark models, and conceptual benchmark models at selected FLUXNET sites.

## Dataset

The datasets that are ingested and analyzed by `plumber` are the ones distributed through the Protocol for the Analysis of Land Surface Models or [PALS](http://dx.doi.org/0.5194/gmd-5-819-2012). Note that there is a PALS website that has been [down](http://pals.nci.org.au) for some time.
